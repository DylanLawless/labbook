# About
This is a LaTeX template for my labbook.
Examples are included to be modified to suit you. 
The main document labbook_2020 should be compiled with latex and bibtex a couple of times. This should match whatver modern tex system is used.
The EPFL style is not official.

Feel free to reuse this template.

# Layout
The main file is labbook_2020.tex.
This inputs the files in the "head" settings.tex and statement.tex.

It then inputs the "main" contents_1. 
The content file is the main place for writing daily work.
I suggest adding additional contents every year so keep things modular and reduce the size of the current working file. 
Methods is also kept in main since I want a separate chapter that can be cross referenced from any of the contents files.

The "tail" is input for the bibliography and other sections that might be at the end, like appendix.

Other features include footnotes and margin notes that appear on the pages where they are used. 
Index can be used where it prints the word that is indexed in the margin as well are printing to the index section at the end of the document listing page numbers.
